# SpaceGamesApp
An Android app containing 4 different mini-games.

The entire app is space-themed, including all the games. The first game is a Galaga type game where you contorl a spaceship and shoot bullets at enemy ships. The next game is a memory matching game, with space themed images. Next, there is a rock-paper-scissors game, but once again its is space themed. The last game is called "Whack-an-Alien", and is a spinoff of whack-a-mole.

This project was done with Java in Android Studio.
